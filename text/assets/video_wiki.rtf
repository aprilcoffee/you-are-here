While development of videoconferencing started in the late 19th century, the technology only became available to the public starting in the 1930s. These early demonstrations were installed at "booths" in post offices and shown at various world expositions. It took until 1970 for AT&T to launch the first true videoconferencing system, wherein anyone could subscribe to the service and have the technology in their home or office. Videotelephony also included "image phones" which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 plain old telephone service}}\'a0(POTS) lines, essentially the same as\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 slow-scan TV}}.
